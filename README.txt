Tracking and Visualization Software

As of 15th Jan 2013
1. GUI framework is complete
It is quite self explanatory however I would like to do some small user analysis
2. All 2D parts are over including the player
3. 3D imersive visualization is now possible

TODO:
Do player buttons for 3D immersive --done
Loading and saving the processed data--done
Do the scene manipulation group--done
Export to VTK for VESuite - Refer with Doug McCorkle 
Join the code with Nik's framework?(yet to be decided)
Write up documentation for the software

Target (Estimated) Date of Completion: Feb 20th 2013

Once the GUI is complete and working I will make a setup file to see if its working
Once the software is complete I will move on to improving the tracking algorithm
